# My Personal Project

## Moondial

The application, *Moondial* will attempt to teach the user to determine the approximate time, based on the Moon's 
position in the sky. The precision will be determined by the precision of the angle specified Time approximation will 
only be possible when the moon is visible in the user's sky view. The application will use data inputted by the user such as:
- current moon phase
- position in the sky 
- approximate angle to the horizon
- not account for daylight savings and only be applicable in the Northern Hemisphere

Consequently, *Moondial* serves to fulfill my overdue promise to a kid, who is an astronomy fanatic and will teach 
them how to use the moon to determine what time it is. Previously, I drew diagrams and explanations on paper to which 
they could not decipher without assistance. With the current situation of COVID-19, I doubt that I will be able to 
teach them in person. Hopefully this application will be simple enough for a child to use and will successfully teach 
any user how to use the moon, when it is visible, to determine the approximate time.  

### User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to add an observation to a list of observations
As a user, I want to see the data from past observations
As a user, I want to see a summary of my past observations categorized by moon phase
As a user, I want to select observations to delete
